# free-edtech

Welcome to the **Free EdTech** repository! This project aims to provide free online resources for various paid courses offered by different ed-tech organizations. Basically for the paid courses we'll take their provided course outlines and list a number of free resources for each topic of that outline. Our goal is to make education accessible to everyone by curating high-quality, free resources based on course outlines.

## Introduction

Education should be accessible to everyone. With this repository, we curate free resources that align with the outlines of paid courses offered by various ed-tech organizations. By leveraging freely available content, we aim to provide an alternative path for learners to gain knowledge without financial barriers. Also those who love to make free resources can refer this repo to know which topics doesn't have much free resources out there.

## How It Works

1. **Course Outline**: We take a course outline from a paid course (with proper credit to the original source). We may elaborate the outlines for better understanding/easeness.
2. **Resource Curation**: For each topic and sub-topic in the course outline, we provide a list of free resources available online.
3. **Contribution**: The community is encouraged to contribute by adding more free resources or updating existing ones.

## Sample Course Template

Basically a sample of how you can add a course's outline wise resources given here, first create a folder under `courses` folder naming the course that you wanna add, then create a `README.md` file inside that and put the outline wise resources in that readme file as like this sample way. If you wanna put any pdf/images you can put them inside the folder accordingly and link that in the readme section.

### course-name

"course-name" course is offered by "X" and we got the outline from their website, we may modified the outline for elaborating to more details.
